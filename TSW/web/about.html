                    </h2>
            <p>
                  
“Poetry as they say, is the language of the souls”.
An omnifarious lot, that strives to bring out the best of a thinker, reader and writer in you. We manifest ourselves as a motivated group of novices who are here to grow, as individuals and as a team.
                TSW is a platform to share and think upon the thoughts, the emotions and the perceptibility which are often very less talked about. We also equally focus on the development of skills among the interested individuals through workshops by experienced speakers and authors.</p>

            <h3>Foundation </h3>
                <P>The Soul Within, now a flourishing literary club based primarily in the Indian city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh took roots in the month of January’18 with the vision to reach out to the writing community of the city in large numbers and incorporate in them, a feeling of the common connecting bond that all writers possess along with the necessary skills that go a long way in the development of individuals into more prolific, writers and speakers. An affluent idea of an engineering brain that brought this team together comprising majorly of toilers from the technical field who now are no less than family. A testimony yet again of the beauty art holds and how effortlessly it binds people to dream, cooperate and achieve together.</P>


            <h3>Mission </h3>
                <P>
To develop ourselves into better, content-driven, dynamic wielders of the pen who continuously wish to develop the writing community into a well-transformed, organised one where everyone can voice their thoughts and thus bring about a positive change in the way people live.
                </P>
            <h3>Vision </h3>
<p>A society wherein everyone can voice their opinions and thoughts about the world and its processes with the freedom necessary. And where legitimate, just practices come into being with mutual diligence and honesty towards the performing arts.
